## Questions for ‘What is Web Accessibility?’ podcast

### Format
1. Introduction
2. Let’s start with telling us a bit about your career and what you currently do within Allstate.
  * Nicholas
  - This answer could be a podcast in itself.. my first full time job was back in 98 and I've worked for companies large and small since then
  - I've have worked in the public sector, banking sector, insurance sector, a web development shop and a start up.
  - Now in Allstate I am in the FEE engineering team working with a development team om one of Alstates largest web property that has a very substantial userbase
  * Gareth
  - uni, ad agency, allstate
  - part of FEE team working on one of the companies largest and most used products.
3. When people talk about ‘Web Accessibility’ what exactly do they mean?
  * Nicholas
  - Web accessibility is the inclusive practice of ensuring there are no barriers that prevent interaction with, or access to, websites on the World Wide Web by people with physical disabilities, situational disabilities, and socio-economic restrictions on bandwidth and speed. When sites are correctly designed, developed and edited, generally all users have equal access to information and functionality.
  - Companies that create browsers such as google, apple, microsoft and mozilla spend a lot of money ensuring that your code renders on screen what you intended but when users are accessing your site by for example using a screen reader your source code may not convey the same details that can be parsed visually so its important to take into consideration Web Accessibility when creating your website
 - Equality Act 2010 
 - Duty to make reasonable adjustments for disabled people
 - A person ... concerned with the provision of a service to the public or a section of the public (for payment or not) must not discriminate against a person requiring the service by not providing the person with the service.

5. Can you describe the first project you worked on with web accessibility in mind?
  * Nicholas
   - going to say that although I would have always tried to keep sites readable and keep users in mind that this is the first time I have been involved in a substantial effort to fully comply with WCAG AA for every single facet of accessing a website for all users whether they are impaired or not.
   - In previous iterations of web development stacks you could view all your code and that made it easier to take into consideration accessibility considerations such as semantic HTML but with javascript framework single page app component based architecture you are maybe working on a component in isolation from the rest of the codebase and its harder to ensure that your component is accessibile in relation to the rest of the application at development time
   - although now we have so many ways to tackle accessiblity through unit tests, integration and end-to-end tesing, QA, screenreader testing, colour testing, etc
6. What are the needs that Web Accessibility aims to address?
 - Can you give some examples of Visual impairments?
   * Gareth
    - This is when a user can't see low contrast test - Visual impairments including blindness, various common types of low vision and poor eyesight, various types of color blindness;

 - can you tell us a bit about cognitive impairments?
 * Nicholas
   - User has an issue with understanding complex language, Developmental disabilities, learning difficulties (dyslexia, dyscalculia, etc.), and cognitive disabilities (PTSD, Alzheimer's) of various origins, affecting memory, attention, developmental "maturity", problem-solving and logic skills, etc.
7. How do you go about understanding the users diversity?
 * Gareth
8. As UI engineers, how can you make the web more accessible?
 * Gareth
9. What Web Accessibility Tools are available for developers?
 * Nicholas
 - Unit Testing - axe-core  
 - End to End Testing - axe-webdriverjs  
 - Chrome DevTools tools - Accessibility Tab in the Styles Windows
 - Chrome extensions - site improve, axe, lighthouse  
 - Screen readers, Narrator for windows, Voiceover for mac - https://webaim.org/articles/voiceover/  
 - Manual Testing  
 - Visibility Colour Contrast - color contrast analyzer, site improve acces
10. What assistive technologies are used for web browsing?
 * Gareth
11. What guidelines are available for the developers and designers?
 * Nicholas
12. Accessibility can’t fall on one person’s shoulders. It’s a collective involvement throughout
your organisation and projects. Do you agree?
 * Nicholas, Gareth
