  * Nicholas
   - going to say that although I would have always tried to keep sites readable and keep users in mind that this is the first time I have been involved in a substantial effort to fully comply with WCAG AA for every single facet of accessing a website for all users whether they are impaired or not.
   - In previous iterations of web development stacks you could view all your code and that made it easier to take into consideration accessibility considerations such as semantic HTML but with javascript framework single page app component based architecture you are maybe working on a component in isolation from the rest of the codebase and its harder to ensure that your component is accessibile in relation to the rest of the application at development time
   - although now we have so many ways to tackle accessiblity through unit tests, integration and end-to-end tesing, QA, screenreader testing, colour testing, etc
